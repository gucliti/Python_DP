The Challenge
#In this exercise, you're going to decompress a compressed string.

#Your input is a compressed string of the format number[string] and the decompressed output form should be the string written number times. For example:

#The input

#3[abc]4[ab]c

#Would be output as

#abcabcabcababababc

#Other rules
#Number can have more than one digit. For example, 10[a] is allowed, and just means aaaaaaaaaa

#One repetition can occur inside another. For example, 2[3[a]b] decompresses into aaabaaab

#Characters allowed as input include digits, small English letters and brackets [ ].

#Digits are only to represent amount of repetitions.

#Letters are just letters.

#Brackets are only part of syntax of writing repeated substring.

#Input is always valid, so no need to check its validity.

#Learning objectives
#This question gives you the chance to practice with strings, recursion, algorithm, compilers, automata, and loops. Itâ€™s also an opportunity to work on coding with better efficiency.
